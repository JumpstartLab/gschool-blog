The event reporter 

READMORE


The first project we completed in G-School was definitely not easy for me. It spanned the gap from the previous warm ups by having no tutorial to walk you through. While this created an environment conducive for asking many more questions, it also was difficult for me to start the project as I really had no reference of where to even begin. 

As the hours ticked away, a few of the more novice, frustrated students banded together. The hope was that we would magically comprehend the project while talking through it, and would get more then a few lines down. With the help of a few incredibly patient and talented peers, we worked through the process of starting our command prompts and a few preliminary methods.

Over the next few days I spent roughly 15 hours on the event_reporter program. I would try to maximize time spent in the class asking figuring out what element to do next, and then bounce around to my classmates after hours to get a feel for what strategy others were using in their programs. 

Overall, I was happy with the output but realize I have a ton of room to improve. My score reflected my effort, but I still chose to work with Jeffâ€™s group for the wrap-up as I am still very fuzzy on many of the elements within my own program. 

I realize projects from here on will only become more difficult. When I look at the macro view of the first two weeks, I feel like we were all thrown into the lions den, regardless of out skill or experience, and despite my frustration & near mental-breakdowns, I learned a lot this week from this trial-by-fire project.
