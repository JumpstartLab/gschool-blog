Code with Class

READMORE


To fully learn Ruby seems to be a highly creative proccess, and part of what drew me into G-School was the poetic-esque vocabulary of the language. At first glance, ruby looks like something you can read; far from the few other programming languages I have seen - which resemble a gibberesh made of colons and brackets. "Eloquent Ruby" is the conneseur's cookbook for high class code. The subtle nuances of Ruby seem endless, and just because you can doesn't mean you should. When a certain method or coding route works that does not mean that is the preffered way to do things. 

To code with class is the end goal because really, who strives to be 'just good enough.' Learning to absorb the style from the very beggining of the learning proccess, hopefully I can integrate it into my foundation while learning Ruby.
