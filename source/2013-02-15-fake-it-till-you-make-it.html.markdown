"Fake it till you make it"

READMORE


It is nearly 1 month into the G-School program, and each day leaves me knowing more about the Ruby programming language then the day before. However, I feel very far from being a developer. It has been a very stressful few weeks for me thus far, as I rarely take opportunities that truly push my boundaries and limits. While most of this pressure is coming from my own intention to do well,  

G-School has taken my comfort zone and smashed it to pieces. I normally refer to my comfort zone in regards to physical space, such as traveling to unknown places with a backpack and zero plans, but learning something completely new,has really got me asking lots of questions about the subject and myself. 

I am excited every day about learning the craft of writing code, but there are times when I question my ability. (These moments are usually wrapped around a glaze in comprehension, when something flies  miles over my head.) But thats okay, or at least I am starting to realize that thats okay. Im not going to magically absorb this material overnight, unfortunately, and its going to be a very long 6 months, filled with many hours poured into first basic, then more advanced topics.

The class environment has been really cohesive. At the start I was nearly as excited to make like minded friends as I was to learn Ruby on Rails. We are all on our way to carving out a little community here at Galvanize, and am excited for the next few months with these people, hopefully making some lifelong friends and potential business partners. 

  Nonetheless, the pace of the group has been a struggle for me. While ALL questions are encouraged, it can be difficult to ask about simple method structures and syntax, when your peers are discussing what is the most efficient way to call an API, to refactor their programs, or incorporate all sorts of crazy shit. When I need help, I am trying to ask more questions especially when they seem dumb or obvious to me. Its been the most challenging thing for me to ask what 3/4 of the class already knows, but that is why I am here. As for resources, my classmates have definitely been my support. I realize teaching only cements in your learning more, but when someone is knee deep in their own issues, I tend to steer away from dropping my problems on them. Im working to find a balance of self-support, peer-support, and of course instructor-support. 

Well wish me luck those who read this. I am ready to put my all into learning something scary, and as my fear of the unknown was diagnosed by a fellow classmate, i’m just going to “fake it, till I make it.”
