I have answered the question "do I feel like a developer" probably 4 times into the course. I just now realize that although my skills improve vastly each week, I wont feel like a developer until someone pays me. The course has been the hardest thing I have ever mentally done, and my emotions over the last two months have been quite erradic. The stress, frustration, and exhaustion of sturggling through the course's difficulties has left me hazy on many topics. I do wish there were more begginners in the class as a whole, as I think I could be learning a lot more if there was more focus on the newbies. But hey, thats just not how it is, so Im hangingin in there, trying not to be frustrated with anyone but myself. 

Okay enough whining. 

Rails 'seems' super awesome. It is still a bit mystical to me, recalling from tutorials and blogs that people say 'Oh just trust me, do this thing here. Rails will take care of that for you.' As of now, im not sure what 'it' is, but I already like it. The final frontier in my eyes - A framework where I will actually be able to create things. Talking with my parents a few days ago, they (like many people) had website needs that they paid TOP dollar to get taken care of. The products they reveived were built through wordpress and who knows what, and were not of the quality that many of the projects myself and classmates have built already. Thats exciting to me, realizing that the skill we are learning are skills that people incredibly value. 


As for the question about which speakers I would like to see, everyone I have heard of in the Ruby community has already spoken with us! So great job. Each speaker brings with them a very unique set of skills, experiences, and outlook on life and programming, and while many of their passions don't neccesarily interest my own, I really have appreciated the time and effort that they have put in. Hmmmmm,if I had to pick one though I would love to hear from a small time freelance rails developer. Nobody in particular. Just a person who has good rails skills, what their focus includes, and how they find freelance work.
