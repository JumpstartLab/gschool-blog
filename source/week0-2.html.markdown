Surrounding Yourself with Talent

READMORE

While the incessant references to the author’s jazz music career are a dime a dozen in the “Passionate Programmer,” the analogy of always being the worst member in a band is really applicable to any career or activity. When you surround yourself with  talent greater then your own will always push the boundaries and limitations that you thought you were capable of. 

 For example, as a skateboarder and snowboarder, I constantly strive to ride with people who are much better than me. I see the tricks and style that I wish I could achieve, and change my technique to mimic those better then me. When I used to find myself being the best one in a group, I would stop pushing myself, and my top performance would begin to stagnate at a certain level I deemed ‘my best’ due to having nothing better to compare it to.
I think Chad’s main point in relation to software development in that if you are never comparing yourself to other talented developers, you really have no idea if you are doing your best. 

In addition to expanding talent, finding a go-to mentor that pushes my limitations is a goal for me in the next few weeks. While I don’t perceive myself as being quite ready to mentor someone else, I would like to be comfortable teaching the basics back as an aid for my own learning. After all, the best thing I can do to cement this new knowledge in my brain would be to teach it along.
