Programming for Dummies

READMORE


Who knew I would be back in the classroom so soon. Googling new vocabulary terms, collaborating with my peers, and taking notes on key points of lectures is nothing new to me, however 100% of the content is. 

Computer programming is terrifying to me, but not as terrifying as it was last week. I came into g-school with zero programing experience, so upon meeting my classmates, I realized that I had a few others in my boat which was quite the stress release. However, that does not mean that g-school will be any easier for us. 

After the first week I have only started to realize the scope of the program, and am just as anxious as I am excited to start building real applications. I am ready to give it my all, but at the same time am trying to mentally prepare myself for the imminent ass-kicking over the next six months.
