A week of much needed review

READMORE


The breakup of the class into three groups came at a crucial time. Personally I have been a bit frustrated lately. However I am not really frustrated with anyone in particular. I am just dissapointed with the amount of time I have put into the course and the level of my comprehension up to this point. 

  Our core group of 7 have spent the week going over the very basics of ruby. We have implemented TDD(test-driven-development) for each mini project religiously, and to a bit of suprise to myself, I have hammered in the basics that allow me to ake baby steps in order to solve simple problems. This is opposed to last week when I would have an idea, but no clue of how to even begin to implement my strategy. 


I knew this course was not going to be even close to easy, but at this moment I am pretty nervous of whats to come. As the weeks roll by I feel me and a few others are lagging further behind or as our main instructor put it "not on track to graduate." I feel more like a burden than a student at this point, and although they made the effort to split us into a remediation group, I feel my skills are not even up to the point where I could tackle past projects. Anyway i'm going to keep on trucking till I can't anymore, but hopefully I wont hit that wall anytime soon, if ever.
