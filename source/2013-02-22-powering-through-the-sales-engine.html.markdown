The look on my face when we were first given the sales engine project must have been priceless. Im assuming I had my jaw dropped, eyes wide, and my brain was throbbing in an attempt to comprehend the scope of the endeavor. Yet somehow, I made it through, absorbing, learning, and contributing as much as I possibly could. Luckily I was paired with Danny who had a grasp on the concept and lead us through the daunting task at hand. I acted as a co-pilot / or more likely a flight attendant / picking up any simple tasks I could handle and pointing out typos or mistakes that my newbie knowledge saw differently. However I learned a TON about the process of writing a project from scratch. Danny was patient with my aptitude and made an effort to exlpain each step in the process before hurdling on to the next feature, bug, or error in our program. 

Part of me was glad that I had such a problem-solving partner, but it left me a little worried that maybe I was supposed to be understanding more of the concepts clealy and that a longer, tougher struggle would have been better for me in the long run. I can't lie though that Im glad its over. 

Although I could never deliver danny any polished features or extensions to fluidly merge into our master branch, I was there late in the evenings hunching over the errors in our test spec just the same. I would occasionally feel like a burden, slowing down the creative process, but other times I would hop in and point something out that clicked. 


Things I will take into the next project.
  > -Fully comprehend the scope and organize accordingly
  > -Use more daylight hours (can't think when i'm tired)
  > -Continue to pair program when possible

And once again - back to the issue of whether I feel like a developer or not. I think I will only feel like a developer when I can be competent to work on my own. This has not been an easy month and I am pretty confident it's not going to get any easier. Just trying to keep my head above water at this point; learning to swim part is my first priority.
