  Using basic tags to alter your text seems like the most basic altering you can do to your webpage.<hr />

    However, it seems that understanding the basic foundations of HTML manipulation is a solid way to understand more complext mechanisms that use CSS, Bootstrap, or Javascript.<hr />

  <p><strong>The most confusing aspect I found</strong><p>
    was the formation of ordered and unordered lists.
    While this wasnt not neccesarily difficult, It did trip me up with the repetition and small typo errors. I tried practicing each technique and getting it succesful before moving onto the next tag or technique.
    <ol>
      <li>First I setup the infrastructure of the tags
          <ul>
            <li> Which sometimes looked messy</li>
          </ul>
      <li>Then I would set up closing tags before filling in info.</Li>
      <li>and finally filling in the text so it made sense</Li>
    </ol><hr />

<p> My favorite parts of the first section included the ability to link to pictures, emails, or any external URL using the "< a href= ... tag". This allows the designer to link to emails and urls such as <br />
  <a href="http://www.nomadicknight.com" target="_blank">My Travel website</a></p>

  <p>In addition it makes the designer able to link pictures and determine their size, across any type of discplay the user might be using. for example here is a random picture I had on my computer.
    <img src="/images/my_images/Girl Rising.jpg" title="random picture" /> </p>

  <p>While I got tons to learn on HTML5 & CSS, it is nice to practice something that has a direct output. You can see how right <em>(or wrong)</em> you are in <strong>realtime.</strong></p>
