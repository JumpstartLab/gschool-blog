Don't be so mysterious...

As I am just getting my feet wet learning my first programming language Ruby, it is hard for me to relate to the abstract thoughts the author has about software development. His attitude generally seems that while skills are important, careers are made through networking, attitude, and strong traits of character.  It is easy for me to relate to the lessons of life, but due to my lack of actual programming experience, it all seems to good and easy to be true.  In the latter section of Chad’s book, “The Passionate Programmer,” I can identify a few snippets that truly resonate with me despite my limited experience in the tech field. 

Just because someone does not understand computers, does not mean they are stupid. According to Chad, many programmers are known for being anti-social, and even condescending towards those who require their assistance. By far one of the most important assets I can predict will be essential in programming is making your clients feel comfortable. The unknown is very scary.  If your comprehension of programming is low,  it would be very intimidating giving lots of money to people who are mysteriously completing their side of the bargain. Maybe they are ripping you off on work hours, or perhaps they are building it a different way then asked. The author states that, “Your customers are afraid of you.” This makes me see how being a ‘tour guide’ through the technological process can be one of the most rewarding traits in a developer, even trumping skill... Assuming you can deliver of course. 

Another aspect that Chad dives into is open source software contributions. While the big money seems to mostly be found at high profile corporate programming jobs, the celebrities of the tech world are all open source contributors. If I had to choose a new hire, between a hardworking 9-5, career experienced dev. or a 24/7 passionate, unique, freelancing, open source contributor  - the passion would surpass any resume. Chad’s insight into the world of web careers are strong, and considering his experience I should listen to him. At this point however, I need to focus on simply learning to code and my career path decisions will hopefully follow :)
