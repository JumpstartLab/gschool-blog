30 days down / 150 to go

The g-school group consists of an entirely different specrtum of people. Our relationships continue to evolve with each stressful endeavour, and we are getting to know eachother's strengths and weaknesses as we spend more time togethor struggling through project issues. 

I am nervous for the individual evaluation first off, because I wasnt aware we were going to have them. However, I am also looking forward to it beacuse my own perspective of my knowledge is usually played down when I compared it to my far more experienced classmates.

I have a resolution to be able to contribute more on projects, but I am not sure what that will entail because Its not like I am not working incredibly hard day-to-day. Perhaps spend less hours on rathole project issues and maybe more time finding review to catch up? The feeling of falling behind has been incredibly stressfull on me so I want to focus more on fundamentals, which is so difficult because the class is hurdling forward with a new concept every day..

As exciting as it is working with the web directly, and seeing your output in realtime(albeit the local host), it has been quite frustrating to stumble through the first few steps. A few times during the setup, I literally had no idea what we were doing.. I keep wondering if gschool has some type of super secret learning strategy consisting of 'staring at something untill it makes sense'. I comprehend pieces of the puzzle, but the complexity of the interlinking technologies has me twisted at most times. I had trouble with the tutorials that taught us SQL and Sequel, because immedietely after we were like... oh were not even going to use these.. its just to understand what Sqlite3 will do.. Hard for me because that was the first introduction to this shit I have ever had. Anyway, like anything, its exciting when you do well, and frustrating when you struggle. 

My favorite class session this week was 'How the Web Works' which talked about browsers, frameworks, and databases. I enjoyed the fact that we were starting to learn about a universal facets of the programming world and learning about how databases are used in the daily web world. I also really enjoy when Jeff talks about hacking. Although I am nowhere close to the ability, or even desire to hack, it is really intersting to learn about the exploited loopholes in the web framework and the reality that nothing is really anonymous on the web.
